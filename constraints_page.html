		<div id="paragraphbox"> <p class="medium-text">The constraints on knives include its ability to become blunt through wearing down through use and time, thus removing its ability to divide things. This can be solved through sharpening it. The blade without the handle would create the constraint of discomfort in holding it, however the handle solves this issue. The material the knife is made out of can be metal, porcelain or even plastic. The different materials determine how sharp the knife can be and therefore its cutting ability. The cooking knife is typically made out of metal, which is easily sterilized. After some use it becomes blunt however it can be sharpened.
	<br> <br>
	Due to its sharpness, knives and like objects have been associated with danger and pain. Humans have developed the cultural constraint to be careful around knives, handle them with care, do not allow children near them and to generally be cautious as they easily can cause harm. Using them as a weapon is now regarded as unacceptable and only acceptable function is as an aid to daily tasks. </p>
