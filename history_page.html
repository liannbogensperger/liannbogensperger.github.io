		<div id="paragraphbox"> <p class="small-text">Knives originated as early as 2.6 million years ago; however, they were found in different materials and in a less sleek form. These ancient knives were found in the form of sharp stones, teeth or bones that had a blade like edge. In times of cavemen, these sharp stones were attached on the top of long wood poles to create a spear like weapon for hunting and fishing. <br><br>As humanity developed and metals were able to be extracted and shaped, the knife was made from these more durable materials. The early metals such as copper, bronze and tin were not as sharp as the original stone blades and lost their ability to cut easily as they were worn down through use over time. This causes the need for sharpening stones the restore their fine point.<br><br> 3600 years ago, humans developed the ability to extract iron core and started making knives from the material. Iron is durable and also keeps sharpness better than the other metals. The alloy steel proved to be the most effective material and today the majority of knives are still made from it. <br> <br>Knives have developed into different sizes, with larger ones, such as swords were used as a weapon and are often seen today as a medium of violence. In 1669, King Louis XIV of France placed a ban on the use of knives in an effort to reduce violence. Today the knife has many uses ranging from cutlery, weapon, medical aid, and for anything that requires a sharp edge. </p>
