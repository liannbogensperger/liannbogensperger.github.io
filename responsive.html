				The knife is used for slicing and cutting things. This is its affordance and is easily recognized by its extremely sharp edge. The metal material gives it a harsh and stable impression, allowing the user to know it will not break from using it. It gives the impression of strength. From this, we know its intention is to cut and divide things as it is stronger than most other materials. The jagged edge on the blade itself shows that this side is the one that will be used to slice any material. The other side of the blade is blunt and straight, thus preventing the function of cutting. The tip shows where the most force can be built up and therefore its sharpest point. <br> <br>Additionally, the difference between incredibly sharp edge and the smooth handle, shows where the knife should be held. You use the knife with your hands. The blade is sharp and could be harmful to touch therefore, it is designed with a handle piece for comfort. The handle piece is made of smooth plastic that allows comfort for the user. This drastically opposes the sharpness of the blade itself. The black color further highlights where the sharp blade ends, and the smooth handle starts. The top of the handle connects at a right angle with the blade, creating a clear barrier to protect the user from the sharp knife. It is shaped to fit perfectly in the grip of the hand, easy to hold and maneuver. The handle is a cylinder shape, to easily allow the grip of the hand to form around it. <br> <br>Knives are used in everyday life and must be convenient and simple to use. They are light and slender, so that it can align with the movement of the hand. Its sleek and slim design make it easy to store. </p>
